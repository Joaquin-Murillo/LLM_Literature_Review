# LLM Literature Review
By Joaquin Murillo

## Questions:
There have been countless programming languages created throughout history. But why do some languages become extinct, while others become built upon and iterated? What reasons lead to programming languages becoming irrelevant? What are some features of the current programming languages that kept them relevant? Were there any external reasons that led to these outcomes?

### Reasons Why Programming Languages Become Irrelevant
1. Technological Obsolescence:
* Hardware Evolution: Early languages were designed for specific hardware. As computing hardware advanced, languages that couldn't adapt became obsolete.
* New Programming Paradigms: The rise of paradigms like object-oriented, functional, and concurrent programming made languages lacking these features less attractive.
* Inability to Handle Modern Needs: Languages not designed to handle web development, mobile apps, or cloud computing couldn't meet new demands.

2. Lack of Community and Industry Support:
* Small or Inactive Community: Without a vibrant community, a language lacks updates, libraries, and forums for problem-solving.
* Vendor Abandonment: If a company stops supporting a language (e.g., due to bankruptcy or shifting focus), it may decline without official backing.
* Educational Shift: When academic institutions stop teaching a language, fewer new developers learn it, leading to a dwindling user base.

3. Inferior Features and Performance:
* Poor Performance: Languages that are slow or resource-intensive can be replaced by more efficient alternatives.
* Limited Features: Without modern features like garbage collection, multithreading, or advanced data structures, a language may fall behind.
* Security Vulnerabilities: Languages not designed with security in mind may be abandoned in favor of safer options.

4. Insufficient Ecosystem and Tooling:
* Lack of Libraries and Frameworks: Developers prefer languages with rich ecosystems to speed up development.
* Outdated Tooling: Modern development relies on advanced IDEs, debuggers, and package managers. Languages lacking these may be sidelined.

5. Market and Industry Trends:
* Shift in Industry Needs: As industries evolve, so do their language preferences (e.g., the move from desktop to web applications).
* Regulatory Changes: New laws or standards may require features not supported by older languages.

### Features That Keep Current Programming Languages Relevant
1. Active Community and Open-Source Support:
* Continuous Development: Languages like Python and JavaScript have communities that contribute to regular updates and improvements.
* Collaborative Ecosystem: Open-source contributions lead to a wealth of libraries and frameworks.

2. Adaptability and Evolution:
* Regular Updates: Languages that evolve by adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving performance stay current.
* Backward Compatibility: Maintaining compatibility ensures that existing projects remain functional.

3. Robust Ecosystems:
* Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: A rich ecosystem (e.g., Node.js for JavaScript, Django for Python) makes a language more versatile.
* Tooling and IDE Support: Languages with strong tooling support improve developer productivity (e.g., IntelliJ for Java).

4. Performance and Efficiency:
* Optimized Compilers and Interpreters: Enhancements in how code is executed keep languages competitive.
* Resource Management: Effective memory and process management make a language suitable for large-scale applications.

5. Versatility and Multi-Paradigm Support:
* Support for Multiple Paradigms: Languages like Scala support object-oriented and functional programming, increasing their applicability.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Languages that run on various operating systems attract a wider audience.

6. Educational and Industry Adoption:
* Curriculum Inclusion: Languages taught in schools (e.g., Python) see increased adoption.
* Industry Standards: Languages adopted as industry standards (e.g., SQL for databases) remain relevant.

7. Ease of Learning and Use:
* Readable Syntax: User-friendly syntax lowers the barrier to entry for new programmers.
* Comprehensive Documentation: Good documentation helps in learning and troubleshooting.

### External Factors Influencing Language Relevance
1. Corporate Backing and Sponsorship:
* Financial and Development Support: Companies like Microsoft (C#) and Google (Go) invest resources into language development.
* Promotion and Adoption: Corporate use and promotion can lead to widespread industry adoption.

2. Market Demand and Job Opportunities:
* Employment Trends: Demand for developers proficient in certain languages keeps them in use.
* Community Events and Conferences: Events promote languages and keep the community engaged.

3. Technological Trends:
* Emerging Fields: Languages that cater to new fields (e.g., Swift for iOS development) gain popularity.
* Open-Source Movement: The rise of open-source software supports languages that embrace this philosophy.

4. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements:
* Legacy Systems Maintenance: Industries bound by regulations may continue using older languages for compliance (e.g., COBOL in banking).
* Security Standards: Languages that meet stringent security standards are preferred in sensitive industries.

### Examples of Programming Languages Upgraded Over Time
1. C Language:
* From C89 to C18: Introduced new standards to improve compatibility, performance, and add features like inline functions and improved Unicode support.

2. C++:
* From C++98 to C++20: Added significant features such as smart pointers, lambda expressions, concurrency support, and modules.

3. Java:
* From Java 1.0 to Java 17: Introduced generics, enhanced concurrency utilities, lambda expressions, the Stream API, and records for data classes.

4. Python:
* Transition from Python 2 to Python 3: Made significant changes to improve consistency and eliminate legacy quirks, like unifying string types and improving integer division.

5. JavaScript (ECMAScript):
* From ES5 to ES2021: Added let and const keywords, arrow functions, promises, async/await, modules, and optional chaining.

6. Fortran:
* From Fortran 66 to Fortran 2018: Evolved to include modern programming constructs like modules, array operations, and object-oriented programming features.

7. COBOL:
* From COBOL 60 to COBOL 2014: Added support for object-oriented programming, XML processing, and updated to work with modern computing environments.

8. Visual Basic:
* From VB6 to VB.NET: Transitioned to the .NET framework, introducing object-oriented features and improved interoperability with other .NET languages.
