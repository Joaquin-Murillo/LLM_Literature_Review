# LLM Literature Review
By Joaquin Murillo

## Questions:
There have been countless programming languages created throughout history. But why do some languages become extinct, while others become built upon and iterated? What reasons lead to programming languages becoming irrelevant? What are some features of the current programming languages that kept them relevant? Were there any external reasons that led to these outcomes?

### Reasons Why Programming Languages Become Irrelevant
1. **Technological Obsolescence:**
* **Hardware Evolution:** Early languages were designed for specific hardware. As computing hardware advanced, languages that couldn't adapt became obsolete.
* **New Programming Paradigms:** The rise of paradigms like object-oriented, functional, and concurrent programming made languages lacking these features less attractive.
* **Inability to Handle Modern Needs:** Languages not designed to handle web development, mobile apps, or cloud computing couldn't meet new demands.

2. **Lack of Community and Industry Support:**
* **Small or Inactive Community:** Without a vibrant community, a language lacks updates, libraries, and forums for problem-solving.
* **Vendor Abandonment:** If a company stops supporting a language (e.g., due to bankruptcy or shifting focus), it may decline without official backing.
* **Educational Shift:** When academic institutions stop teaching a language, fewer new developers learn it, leading to a dwindling user base.

3. **Inferior Features and Performance:**
* **Poor Performance:** Languages that are slow or resource-intensive can be replaced by more efficient alternatives.
* **Limited Features:** Without modern features like garbage collection, multithreading, or advanced data structures, a language may fall behind.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Languages not designed with security in mind may be abandoned in favor of safer options.

4. **Insufficient Ecosystem and Tooling:**
* **Lack of Libraries and Frameworks:** Developers prefer languages with rich ecosystems to speed up development.
* **Outdated Tooling:** Modern development relies on advanced IDEs, debuggers, and package managers. Languages lacking these may be sidelined.

5. **Market and Industry Trends:**
* **Shift in Industry Needs:** As industries evolve, so do their language preferences (e.g., the move from desktop to web applications).
* **Regulatory Changes:** New laws or standards may require features not supported by older languages.
